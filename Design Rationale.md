## Target Users

Capture Nuptials is designed for couples, families, and event planners who want to book professional photographers for weddings and special occasions in a simple 
and convenient way. The primary users are busy individuals who prefer a structured digital booking experience instead of making phone calls or manually coordinating
with photographers. The app is especially focused on wedding clients who value elegance, trust, and clarity in service selection.

## Booking Flow Logic
--The booking flow follows a clear, guided, and linear structure to minimize confusion and improve task completion:
Splash → Onboarding → Authentication → Event Selection → Photographer Selection → Date & Time Selection → Event Details → Booking Summary → Confirmation Screen.

--Each screen is designed to focus on one main action at a time. The user first understands the value of the app through onboarding,
then logs in, selects their event type, chooses a photographer after reviewing their portfolio, selects a suitable date and time,
adds event details, reviews a structured summary, and finally confirms the booking.

--This step-by-step progression reduces cognitive overload and ensures users always know what to do next.

## UX Decisions

Several key UX decisions were made to enhance usability and maintain a premium experience:
--A dark shade red theme was chosen to reflect luxury, romance, and wedding aesthetics.
--Card-based layouts are used for event types and photographer listings to make content easy to scan and compare.
--A calendar and time-slot interface ensures clear availability visibility and prevents booking conflicts.
--Portfolio preview access builds trust before confirmation.
--A structured booking summary screen reassures users before final confirmation.
--Smooth 300ms Smart Animate transitions with ease-out curves were used to create a refined and professional interaction feel.
--Consistent spacing and visual hierarchy improve readability and overall flow clarity.

## How This Design Improves User Experience

--This design simplifies the appointment booking process into manageable, intuitive steps. By reducing unnecessary complexity and focusing on one task per screen,
users can complete bookings efficiently without feeling overwhelmed.

--The inclusion of portfolio previews and transparent pricing increases user trust. The guided flow reduces decision fatigue,
while the confirmation screen provides reassurance and clarity. The consistent visual theme and smooth animations create a seamless and
premium user journey aligned with the emotional nature of wedding photography services.

--Overall, Capture Nuptials delivers a structured, elegant, and user-centered booking experience that aligns with real-world event planning needs.
